## Hello there! 
### I'm Nancy. 

I'm Computer Science student at MacEwan University. 

With a lifelong appreciation for learning, I'm passionate about incorporating creative solutions into programming and creating engaging user experiences across various platforms. As a technology enthusiast with a minor in Biological Science, I've come to have a deep appreciation of for intersections between technology and human existence.

From game development to web technologies, I thrive on exploring the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm. I'm eager to contribute to cutting-edge projects that blend technical skills and creativity, and am excited to collaborate with like-minded professionals to make meaningful contributions to our understanding of the world and its interconnected systems.
